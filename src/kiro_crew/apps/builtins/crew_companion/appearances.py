"""Appearance packs: the companion's avatar library.

The desktop app kept these in Electron's ``userData`` and served them over IPC. Here
they live in the app's own data directory and are served over HTTP, because the
renderer is a page rather than a privileged window. The pack SHAPE is unchanged — a
manifest plus animation files, as ``appearanceTypes.ts`` defines it — so packs the
user already made remain loadable.

Three properties this has to keep, all learned from the desktop version:

* **A pack the user made is precious.** Custom art is unrecoverable if lost, so writes
  go through a temp file and a rename, and a delete only ever touches a custom pack's
  own directory.
* **A malformed pack must not take the companion down.** A pack is third-party content,
  possibly hand-edited. Anything unreadable is skipped with a warning and the others
  still load, rather than one bad manifest emptying the library.
* **The built-in ghost is not a file.** It ships with the app and cannot be deleted or
  renamed, so it is registered from code and always present even when the custom
  directory is empty.
